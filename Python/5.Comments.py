# Multi-line comments or block comments in Python

and it is not printed on the screen
'''

print("Hello again")  # Print a message

Here are some recommendations on how to use comments:

1. Comments should be complete sentences. If a comment is a phrase or a sentence, its first word should be capitalized, unless it is an identifier that starts with a lowercase letter.

2. If a comment is short, it can be on the same line as the statement. In this case, there should be two spaces before the #, and a space after the #.

3. Multi-line or block comments are generally used to document more complex functionalities.

Lastly, remember that good comments not only describe what the code does, but also why it does it. It is important that comments are clear and useful for anyone who might read your code in the future.
