# Script Repository

Welcome to the **Script Repository**! This repository contains scripts in various programming languages, designed to help with a variety of tasks. Each script is documented with detailed instructions on my blog, [TechNomadiX](https://gaaspkm.online), where you can find more insights, explanations, and use cases.
